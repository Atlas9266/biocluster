Tutorial on building a computing cluster for a bioinformatics lab

## Introduction
I run a [bioinformatics lab](http://genomics.usc.edu) at the University of Southern California. In 2010, I built a computing cluster for lab members, and we have been using the cluster ever since. The university does have a university-wide computing cluster maintained by the [Center for High-performance Computing](https://hpcc.usc.edu/), but we rarely use it for a variety of reasons including lack of storage space. Occasionally some people ask me how I can admin a cluster myself, and I usually point them to the documentation on [Rocks cluster](http://www.rocksclusters.org/wordpress/). However, the documentation may be overly complicated yet insufficient to solve many of the practical problems that I encounter over the past a few years. Therefore, I decided to write a simple tutorial on building a computing cluster for a bioinformatics lab.
