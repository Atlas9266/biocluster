Tutorial on building a computing cluster for a bioinformatics lab

## Introduction

I am the Principal Investigator of a [bioinformatics lab](http://wglab.org). In 2010, I built a computing cluster for lab members, and we have been using the cluster ever since. Occasionally some people ask me how I can admin a cluster myself, and I usually point them to the documentation on [Rocks cluster](http://www.rocksclusters.org/wordpress/). However, the documentation may be overly complicated yet insufficient to solve many of the practical problems that I encountered over the past a few years. Therefore, I decided to write a simple tutorial on building a computing cluster for a bioinformatics lab.
